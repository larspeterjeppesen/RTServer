If defending against a boarding action, a Half Action directs the efforts of his armsmen, granting them a +10 bonus in combat (see page 215).

If the patient is in danger of losing a limb from a Critical Hit (see Chapter IX: Playing the Game), the Explorer provides him with a +20 bonus to the Toughness Test to prevent limb loss.

Master Enginseer
Prerequisites: Tech-Use

Mechadendrite Use
Prerequisites: Explorator
Talent Groups: Weapon, UtilityThough there are many different types of Mechadendrite, this Talent divides them into two broad categories:Weapon: Mechadendrites of this type end in either ranged or close combat weapons, and have the supplemental support and strength necessary for combat.Utility: Including such varied types as Machine Spirit Interface, Manipulator, Medicae, Utility, Optical, and countless others, these Mechadendrites generally require less hardy mountings, but all interface with the Cyber Mantle in a similar manner.

Meditation

Mimic 
Vox synthesisers, training or innate abilities allow the Explorer to accurately mimic the voice of another. He must study the voice patterns of his target for at least one hour for proper imitation, and speak the same language. He cannot accurately copy the voice of a xeno due to the difference in physiology and the subtle complexities of most alien languages. Listeners must succeed on a Difficult (–10) Scrutiny Test to penetrate the deception. If the character studies used vox recordings, or comm-link conversations rather than in-person observation, the Difficulty of the Scrutiny Test is reduced to Challenging (+0). His deception automatically fails if the listener can clearly see he is not the imitated individual.

Navigator
The Explorer was born with the Navigator gene, either of the Navis Nobilite or in the shadowed ranks of the unlicensed. The Warp Eye stares balefully from his forehead, allowing him to perceive the ebbs and flows of the empyrean. For more details, see Chapter 7: Navigator Powers.

The Explorer is a psyker, and his power in game terms is rated on a scale of 1 to 10, where Psy Rating 1 is the lowest to warrant the attentions of the Scholastia Psykana and the Black Ships, and a rating of 10 represents one of the most powerful of the entire human sphere. An Astropath Transcendent begins play with Psy Rating 2. See Chapter VI: Psychic Powers for detailed rules on the game mechanics of this ability. Increasing a character’s Psy Rating represents that character unlocking more of his psychic potential and becoming more and more powerful. Note that Psy Ratings in R

The GM may wish to approve certain choices or have them justified by the character’s past.

Rite of Awe
Prerequisites: Explorator
The Omnissiah has augmetically blessed the Explorer’s voice box, allowing him to recite infrasonic liturgies that trigger awe and fear.

Characters may ignore these effects with a successful Willpower Test. Whilst incanting the rite, the character may not talk or communicate with others. The rite requires two minutes of litanies, and it is considered very bad form to break off the recitation before completion. Humans without auditory implants cannot hear infrasonic sound, and though still affected, will not know the Explorer is speaking.

Rite of Fear

Sure Strike
Prerequisites: Weapon Skill 30
